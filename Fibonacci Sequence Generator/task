Task: Fibonacci Sequence Generator
Description:
Write a function called generateFibonacci that takes in a number n as input and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

Examples:

generateFibonacci(5) should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].
generateFibonacci(8) should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
generateFibonacci(1) should return [0].
Constraints:

The input number n is greater than or equal to 1.
The output should include the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term, inclusive.
Task:
Implement the generateFibonacci function in JavaScript.
