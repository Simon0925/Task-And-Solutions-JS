Task: Vowel Counter
Description:
Write a function called countVowels that takes in a string as input and returns the count of vowels (i.e., 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') in the string. Treat both uppercase and lowercase vowels as the same.

Examples:

countVowels('hello') should return 2 (since 'e' and 'o' are vowels).
countVowels('JavaScript is awesome') should return 6 (since 'a', 'a', 'i', 'a', 'e', and 'o' are vowels).
countVowels('why?') should return 0 (since there are no vowels in the string).
Constraints:

The input string may contain alphabetic characters (both uppercase and lowercase), numeric digits, punctuation marks, and whitespace characters.
Treat both uppercase and lowercase versions of the same vowel as the same character.
Ignore non-alphabetic characters when counting vowels.
Task:
Implement the countVowels function in JavaScript.
